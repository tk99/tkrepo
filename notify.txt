Latest Kodi 16 & 17 Build Updates [COLOR white]18th June 2017[/COLOR]  

For the changelog visit the website [COLOR white]tkwizi.com[/COLOR]

Due to the upcoming closure of the streamtvbox addon I have removed the streamtvbox build from the wizard.  Once a new provider has been found a new build will be released based on their addon.  At the moment this is looking likely to be either sportsnationHD or UltimateMania.
The fluid build has also been removed but you can now find the real-debrid section from this build in the main family and adult builds

Thank you to those that have donated towards the regular upkeep of the build.  If anyone else wishes to donate you can do so at the website [COLOR white]http://paypal.me/tksoftware[/COLOR] add your username only as a message so we know who its from.
